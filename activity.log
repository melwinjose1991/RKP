Feb 2 - Feb 12 [ Week IV ][ Part I : Explore and Model Knowledge Base ]
=======================================================================
- RDF seems like an appropriate model. It is an standard and supported by W3C
	and best for web domain.
- Explored RDFLib library in python
	-	Supports both RDF/XML and JSON-LD
	- 	Supports the graph difference : https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro_to_graphs.html
			- Sample Code : @https://github.com/melwinjose1991/RKP/tree/master/src/melwin/rkp/learning/rdfLib
- Plan for Part II 
	- Requirement for graph-DB/triple-store
	- Design a simple recommendation alogrithm
	- Check for datasets

Jan 23 - Feb 2 [ Week II & III] [ Part I : Explore and Model Knowledge Base ]
=============================================================================
- Explored Semantic Web and Linked Data
	- JSON-LD seems like a promising format to store knowledge
		- Has a well defined semantics, similar to WikiData
		- Need to explore more about Framing and Normalization
			- to convert JSON-LD to graph/tree data-structure for parsing

Jan 15 - Jan 22 [ Week I ] [ Part I : Explore and Model Knowledge Base ]
========================================================================
- Explored WikiData. Complete Summary in 'WikiData.pdf'
	- Have modeled Knowledge Base based on graphs
	- Graph is generated manually by the wiki-community
	
- Projects that are storing text in knowledge base
	- Inquire: http://inquireproject.com/
	- ARISTO : http://allenai.org/aristo/
	- Need to explore their model

- Plan for Week II
	- Explore ARISTO and Inquire
